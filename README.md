Advent of Code 2019
===================

Solutions for the 2019 edition of Advent of Code, with each day in a subfolder of its own.
The plan is to use as many languages and platforms/environments as possible, not excluding obsolete ones.
We'll see how it goes.


Day 1
-----

__JavaScript (Node)__

Quick-and-dirty dependency-less stuff, with equally quick-and-dirty tests (of sorts).


Day 2
-----

__Python (3.8)__

Class-based public-member approach, with unit tests.


Day 3
-----

__PHP (7.3)__

Using various built-in array functions.


Day 4
-----

__Pascal (Turbo Pascal 7)__

A blast from the past! Written and compiled with TPX in dosbox.
